# Virtual Tourist

This is the 5th project in the Udacity iOS Developer nanodegree. It combines UI elements with API interaction by allowing Udacity students to post a location on a map using a fictive name and to view locations other Udacity students (with fictive names) have posted.

## Installation
Clone the github repository and open the project in XCode (It was written with XCode 12.0.1).
git clone https://github.com/cmorierroy/OnTheMap-UdacityProject5

## Usage
You can run the app on Simulator or on your phone (with a USB cord).
